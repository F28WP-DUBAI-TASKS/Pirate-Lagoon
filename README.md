WP GAME Battle TBD / Cannon Water/ Pirates/

Aim of the Game: Players should defend their territories and attempt to bring down the enemy forces by attacking their ships. The only way to win is to destroy all three lives your enemy has.

Game Scenario: The Pirates are trying to conquer lost lands and hidden treasures. But Alas! The Seas are not big enough for more than one Pirate Ship. The only way to decide the 'The Champion of The Lands Uninhabited', is to battle it out in the daunting waters till your dying breaths. The Last One standing is the ultimate winner.

Game Steps: Step 1: 2 Players enter the game and register unique identifying names for their characters.
            Step 2: The Game decides what Pirate ship the players receive. Step 3: The Game Begins.

Step 4: Players have 3 lives each. They get to choose the power and the angle at which the cannon is shot. Step 5: Once a player successfully hits the enemy Pirate Ship, the enemy loses a life and the position of their ship shifts a little. Step 6: The Player which successfully defeats the enemy ship (destroying all 3 lives) will win the game.
