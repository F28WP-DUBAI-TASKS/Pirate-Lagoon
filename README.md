The Pirates are trying to conquer lost lands and hidden treasures. But Alas! The Seas are not big enough for more than one Pirate Ship. The only way to decide the 'The Champion of The Lands Uninhabited', is to battle it out in the daunting waters till your dying breaths. The Last One standing is the ultimate winner.
